   /*! \enum Modes of load library.
    *
    * Each of system family provides your own way:
    *
    * WINDOWS
    * -------
    *
    * DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES
    * If this value is used, and the executable module is a DLL, the system does
    * not call DllMain for process and thread initialization and termination.
    * Also, the system does not load additional executable modules that are
    * referenced by the specified module.
    *
    * Note Do not use this value; it is provided only for backward compatibility.
    * If you are planning to access only data or resources in the DLL, use
    * LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE_EXCLUSIVE or LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_IMAGE_RESOURCE
    * or both.
    *
    * LOAD_IGNORE_CODE_AUTHZ_LEVEL
    * If this value is used, the system does not check AppLocker rules or
    * apply Software Restriction Policies for the DLL.
    *
    * LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE
    * If this value is used, the system maps the file into the calling
    * process's virtual address space as if it were a data file.
    *
    * LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE_EXCLUSIVE
    * Similar to LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE, except that the DLL file is opened
    * with exclusive write access for the calling process. Other processes
    * cannot open the DLL file for write access while it is in use.
    * However, the DLL can still be opened by other processes.
    *
    * LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_IMAGE_RESOURCE
    * If this value is used, the system maps the file into the process's virtual
    * address space as an image file. However, the loader does not load the
    * static imports or perform the other usual initialization steps.
    *
    * Use this flag when you want to load a DLL only to extract messages
    * or resources from it.
    *
    * If forced integrity checking is desired for the loaded file then
    * LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_IMAGE is recommended instead.
    *
    * LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_APPLICATION_DIR
    * If this value is used, the application's installation directory is searched
    * for the DLL and its dependencies. Directories in the standard search path
    * are not searched.
    * This value cannot be combined with LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH.
    *
    * LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_DEFAULT_DIRS
    * This value is a combination of LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_APPLICATION_DIR,
    * LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_SYSTEM32, and LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_USER_DIRS.
    *
    * Directories in the standard search path are not searched.
    * This value cannot be combined with LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH.
    * This value represents the recommended maximum number of directories
    * an application should include in its DLL search path.
    *
    * LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_DLL_LOAD_DIR
    * If this value is used, the directory that contains the DLL is temporarily
    * added to the beginning of the list of directories that are searched for
    * the DLL's dependencies. Directories in the standard search path are not
    * searched.
    *
    * The lpFileName parameter must specify a fully qualified path.
    * This value cannot be combined with LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH.
    *
    * LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_SYSTEM32
    * If this value is used, %windows%\system32 is searched for the DLL and its
    * dependencies. Directories in the standard search path are not searched.
    * This value cannot be combined with LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH.
    *
    * LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_USER_DIRS
    * If this value is used, directories added using the AddDllDirectory or
    * the SetDllDirectory function are searched for the DLL and its
    * dependencies.
    *
    * LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH
    * If this value is used and lpFileName specifies an absolute path,
    * the system uses the alternate file search strategy.
    *
    * This value cannot be combined with any LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH flag.

    *
    * POSIX
    * -----
    *
    * RTLD_LAZY
    * Relocations shall be performed at an implementation-defined time, ranging
    * from the time of the dlopen() call until the first reference to a given
    * symbol occurs.
    *
    * Specifying RTLD_LAZY should improve performance on implementations
    * supporting dynamic symbol binding as a process may not reference all of
    * the functions in any given object. And, for systems supporting dynamic
    * symbol resolution for normal process execution, this behavior mimics
    * the normal handling of process execution.
    *
    * RTLD_NOW
    * All necessary relocations shall be performed when the object is first
    * loaded. This may waste some processing if relocations are performed for
    * functions that are never referenced. This behavior may be useful for
    * applications that need to know as soon as an object is loaded that all
    * symbols referenced during execution are available.
    *
    * Any object loaded by dlopen() that requires relocations against global
    * symbols can reference the symbols in the original process image file,
    * any objects loaded at program start-up, from the object itself as well
    * as any other object included in the same dlopen() invocation, and any
    * objects that were loaded in any dlopen() invocation and which
    * specified the RTLD_GLOBAL flag. To determine the scope of visibility
    * for the symbols loaded with a dlopen() invocation, the mode parameter
    * should be a bitwise-inclusive OR with one of the following values:
    *
    * RTLD_GLOBAL
    * The object's symbols shall be made available for the relocation
    * processing of any other object. In addition, symbol lookup using
    * dlopen(0, mode) and an associated dlsym() allows objects loaded
    * with this mode to be searched.
    *
    * RTLD_LOCAL
    * The object's symbols shall not be made available for the relocation
    * processing of any other object.
