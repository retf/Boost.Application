[section Dependencies]

The Boost.Application is a header only library, but it depends on the following libraries, and they must be available in order to compile programs that use Boost.Application:

* Boost.System for the boost::system::error_code and boost::system::system_error classes.
* Boost.Thread for creating a service thread and synchronization. Windows Service blocks the main thread so, then service thread function would need to be called from a boost thread.
* Boost.Function, Bind for creation of a callbak system and others.
* Boost.Asio for SIGNALs. 
* Boost.TypeIndex or std::type_index used by application context. 
* Boost.Filesystem to directory manipulation.
* Boost.Uuid to application single instantiation.

Furthermore, some of the examples also require the Boost.Program_options libraries in both sides (Window/Unix).
