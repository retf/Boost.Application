[section Suported Application Types]

Boost.Application supports basically 2 flavors of applications that can be:

[section Common Application]
This kind of application is a usual Interactive Terminal application.
[endsect]

[section Server Application]
This kind of application generates a Service (Windows), or a background process/Daemon (Unix).
[endsect]

[note Both versions can be extended using the plugin system provided by library (see [@../html/boost_application/other_features.html#plugin_system 'Extending Application'])
]

Other types of applications can be added in the future, e.g. Apache Module, IIS Module, FastCGI.
